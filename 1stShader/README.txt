My first Shader Graph

Before you begin, make sure that your project is set up properly, and the graphs are loading correctly. See Getting started with Shader Graph for more information.
Create a New Graph

Use the Project Browser to create a new Shader Graph Asset in your project. The Create > Shader Graph will display the various creation options.

A Blank Shader Graph will create a Shader Graph with no selected active targets or block nodes. You will need to select a target via the Graph Settings Menu to continue.

Certain integrations, like Render Pipelines, can also provide pre-configured options for Shader Graphs. For this example, a Universal > Lit Shader Graph has been created and opened.
Create a new node

Use the Create Node menu to create new nodes. There are two ways to open the menu:

    Right click, and select Create Node from the context menu.
    Press the spacebar.

In the menu, you can type in the search bar to look for specific nodes, or browse all nodes in the library. In this example, we'll create a Color node. First, type "color" in the Create Node menu's search bar. Then, click Color, or highlight Color and press Enter to create a Color node.
